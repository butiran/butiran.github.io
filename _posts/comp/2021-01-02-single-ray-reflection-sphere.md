A particle, which performs as spherical convex mirror [[1](#ref1)], can reflect single ray of laser beam based on the law of reflection [[2](#ref2)]. We can consider that the reflection site as a new light source, similar as it [travels from original light source to a certain direction](/comp/single-ray-source-direction) until it arrives at [the reflection site on the spherical particle](/comp/single-ray-reflection-site-on-sphere).


## ray direction after reflection
Using the law of reflection [[2](#ref2)], vector formulation of ray direction after reflection can be obtained [[3](#ref3)].
