Reflection of single ray of laser beam on many spheres can be performed using [single ray reflection on a single sphere](/comp/single-ray-reflection-sphere) consecutively until the beam leaving the observation region or arrving at a light sensor.


## many spheres system
Fig. <a name="#fig:srrms-many-spheres-system">1</a> shows the illustration how a single ray of laser beam reflected multiple times by many spheres.

In each reflection on a spherical particles law of relection [[1](#ref1)] always holds.
