Python can be used in simulating population which depends on starting population, infant mortality, food, fertility x & y, healthcare, agriculture, chance of disaster, and  age of death [[1](#ref1)], a simple dynamical system like pendulum [[2](#ref2)], and random walk [[3](#ref3)]. It can visualize the data using animated graphs [[4](#ref4)] and motion of the objects [[5](#ref5)]. It is only a short introduction to do a simulation using Python.


## library
Following libraries are required to perform a simulation double pendulum with visualization [[5](#ref5)]

- numpy
- scipy.integrate
- matplotlib.pyplot
- matplotlib.animation

A short information about above libraries is as follow [[6](#ref6)]. The first library is NumPy that supports for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, accompanied by a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on them, which gives it functionality comparable to MATLAB. The SciPy is library that adds functionality more MATLAB-like. And the last is Matplotlib, a MATLAB-like plotting package that provides functionality for plotting.
