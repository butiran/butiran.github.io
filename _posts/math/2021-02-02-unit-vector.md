Unit vector is a vector of length 1 and written in symbol with hat ($\hat{}$) [[1](#ref1)]. Examples of common unit vector are $\hat{i}$, $\hat{j}$, and $\hat{k}$, which represent unit vectors in $x$, $y$, and $z$, respectively [[2](#ref2)]. Take a look at a visualization of a unit vector and experience the relation between unit vector and vector components while you are changing them [[3](#ref3)].


## illustration
Let us draw three vectors in $xy$ space as shwon in Fig. <a href="#fig:uv-unit-vectors-in-xy-space">1</a>, where unit vectors always have the same direction with their vectors but with length of one.
