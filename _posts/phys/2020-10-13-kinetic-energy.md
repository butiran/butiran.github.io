Kinetic energy is one type of energy that an object has due to its motion [[1](#ref1)].


## Kinetic energy
A particle with mass $m$ and moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ will have kinetic energy in the form of

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy}
K = \frac12 m (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}) = \frac12 m v^2.
\end{equation}

The last term in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy} is more common then its preceeding term, which is showing the application of [two vectors dot product](vector#dot-product). Kinetic energy has the unit of $\rm J$ or joule. Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy} is for translational motion, while rotational motion will have another form of kinetic energy related to the moment of inertia $I$ instead of mass $m$.


## Excersices
1. Find the kinetic energy of an object with mass $0.5 \ \rm kg$ and moving with velocity $2 \ \rm m/s$.
2. A particle is moving with velocty $\vec{v} = (12 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} + 4 \hat{k}) \ \rm m/s$. If it has mass of $2 \ \rm kg$, calculate its kinetic energy.
