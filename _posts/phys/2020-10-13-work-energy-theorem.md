Here we will discuss about work-energy theorem [[1](#ref1)] and how it helps to solve a problem in easier way compared to the use of dynamics and work concepts together.


## Kinetic energy
A particle with mass $m$ and moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ will have kinetic energy in the form of

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy}
K = \frac12 m (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}) = \frac12 m v^2.
\end{equation}

The last term in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy} is more common then its preceeding term, which is showing the application of [two vectors dot product](vector#dot-product). Kinetic energy has the unit of $\rm J$ or joule.


## Excersices
1. Find the kinetic energy of an object with mass $0.5 \ \rm kg$ and moving with velocity $2 \ \rm m/s$.
2. A particle is moving with velocty $\vec{v} = (12 \hat{i} + 3 \hat{j} + 4 \hat{j}) \ \rm m/s$. If it has mass of 2 kg, calculate its kinetic energy.
