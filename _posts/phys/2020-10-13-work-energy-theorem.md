Here we will discuss about work-kinetic energy theorem [[1](#ref1)] and how it helps to solve a problem in easier way compared to the use of dynamics and work concepts together.


## Kinetic energy
A particle with mass $m$ and moving with velocity $\vec{v}$ will have kinetic energy in the form of

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy}
K = \frac12 m (\vec{v} \cdot \vec{v}) = \frac12 m v^2.
\end{equation}

The last term in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-kinetic-energy} is more common then its preceeding term, which is the application of [dot product of two vectors](vector#dot-product).
