Here we will discuss about work-energy theorem [[1](#ref1)] and how it helps to solve a problem in easier way compared to the use of dynamics and work concepts together.

## Change in kinetic energy
If at initial time $t_i$ a particle with mass $m$ has velocity of $v_i$ and at final time $t_f$ it has velocity of $v_f$ then change of particle's kinetic energy is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wet-work-integral}
\Delta K = K_f - K_i = \frac12 m v_f^2 - \frac12 m v_i^2,
\end{equation}

where the subscript $i$ and $f$ can be any subscript provided by a problem.
