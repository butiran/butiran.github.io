At least there are six processes for ideal gas [[1](#ref1)], but we will only discuss some of them.


## Ideal gas law
There is relation between pressure $p$, volume $V$, amount $n$, and temperature $T$ of an ideal gas through

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:igproc-ideal-gas-law}
pV = nRT,
\end{equation}

which is known as ideal gas law [[2](#ref2)].
