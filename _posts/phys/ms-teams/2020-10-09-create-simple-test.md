A step-by-step how to make a simple test for physics lecture using Microsoft Teams [[1](#ref1)] is discussed here.


## Microsoft Teams
Usually you will have access through your institution using the link <https://teams.microsoft.com/> and will be asked to sign in with your institutional account. It is also assumed that you have already a team for virtual room in creating a test. The team should be the type of Class.


## Creating a quiz of type Choice using Forms
1. In a team of type Class find the tab **Assignments** and click it.
2. Click **Create** button and choose **Quiz**.
3. By Assuming this is the first quis, choose **+ New Quiz**.
4. Click **Unnamed Quiz** and change it to a name you desired, e.g. "Kinematics 1-d".
5. Do **Enter a description** with some information, e.g. "Quiz about 1-d kinematics".
6. Click **+ Add new**.
7. There are types of Choice, Text, Rating, Date, Ranking, Likert, File upload, Net Promoter Score, and Section. Choose **Choice** this time.
8. Fill **Question** with your question, e.g. A particle is at position x1 at time t1 and at position x2 at time t2. A physical quantity obtained using (x2 - x1) / (t2 - t1) is
9. Fill **Option 1** with "acceleration".
10. Fill **Option 2** with "instantanenous velocity".
11. Click **+ Add option** and fill **Option 3** with "average velocity". Click **âœ“** on the right of the option to mark it as right answer.
12. Click **+ Add option** and fill **Option 4** with "average acceleration".
13. Set **Points**, e.g. 25.
14. Activate **Required** to assure that it must be answered.
15. You can use **Preview** on the tab to see how the question is displayed in different gadgets, e.g. **Computer** and **Mobile**.
16. Use the button **Back** on top of the preview to continue editing the question.
17. Continue to add more questions using **+ Add new**. See the next section for the other question beside the first one.
18. After inputting all trial questions, click **Share** on the tab.
19. Choose **Copy** to get the link and you can share it to your target audience, which for this example is as [[2](#ref2)].
20. If you like, you can change the option from **Only people in my organization can respond** to **Anyone with the link can respond**. For now just use the first option.
21. Now the form with name "Kinematics 1-d" is ready but not yet assigned to the class.


## Assign a quiz to the class
1. Choose again a team and followed by choosing **Assignments** tab.
2. Click **Create** button.
3. Choose **Quiz** but now **Choose a Quiz** and pick "Kinematics 1-d". Click **Next** button.
4. Modify the **Title** to something, e,g. "Kinematics 1-d".
5. Make a new category if necessary, e.g. "Quiz" and **Add category**.
6. Fill **Instructions", e.g. "Individual quiz".
7. Set ***Date due** and **TIme due** for the quiz, e.g. "Sat, Oct 10, 2020" and "11:59 PM". 
8. Choose **Save** if you want to change it later or simply **Assign** to make it available to the students.
9. Now an assigment is available in **General**.
10. Click **View assignment** to see it.
11. There is tab named **To return(xx)**, where `xx` is number of assigned students.
12. You can see students' name is in **Name** column, status (Not turned in, Viewed, Turned in) is available in **Status** column, score is in the last column.


## Trial questions
Following trial questions are only for creating the quiz.
1. A particle is at position $x_1$ at time $t_1$ and at position $x_2$ at time $t_2$. A physical quantity obtained using $(x_2 - x_1) / (t_2 - t_1)$ is (a) acceleration, (b) instantanenous velocity, (c) average velocity, (d) average acceleration. Points: 25. Multiple answes: false. Required: true. Answer: c.
2. At $t = 0 \ \rm s$ a partikel has velocity of $1 \ \rm m/s$ and at $t = 1 \ \rm s$ it has velocity of $5 \ \rm m/s$. If it is an non-uniform linear motion, what is its acceleration? (a) 1 m/s^2, (b) 2 m/s^2, (c) 3 m/s^2, (d) 4 m/s^2. Points: 25. Multiple answes: false. Required: true. Answer: d.
3. Following are time $t$ (in $\rm s$) and position of particle $x$ (in $\rm m$) along $x$ axis, $(0, 1)$, $(1, 5)$, $(2, 6)$, $(3, 5)$, $(4, 5)$. What is average velocity and average speed of the particle between $t = 1 \ \rm s$ and $t = 3 \ \rm s$? (a) $0 \ \rm m/s$ and $0 \ \rm m/s$, (b) $0 \ \rm m/s$ and $1 \ \rm m/s$, (c) $1 \ \rm m/s$ and $0 \ \rm m/s$, (d) $1 \ \rm m/s$ and $1 \ \rm m/s$. Points: 25. Multiple answes: false. Required: true. Answer: b.
4. What is the possible value of displacement compared to distance? You must choose all available right answers. (a) magnitude of displacement can be equal to distance, (b) distance can be negative as the magnitude of displacement (c) value of distance can be larger then magnitude of displacement, (d) distance can be zero but magnitude of displacement can not. Points: 25. Multiple answes: true. Required: true. Answer: a and c.


## Note
Other types of question can be also chosen and used. Purpose of this article is only to show how it works and question of type Choice is the simplest way.
