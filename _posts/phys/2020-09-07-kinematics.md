In kinematics we learn about object motion without considering the cause of the motion, i.e. the force [[1](#ref1)]. Parameters of motion, e.g. [position](position), [velocity](velocity), [acceleration](acceleration), and [time](time) [[2](#ref2)], and also others derived from those will be used in describing kinematics. 


## Types of motion
In rectilinear motion or liniear motion, motion can be classified into three types based on its acceleration $a$, where the types are [uniform linear motion](uniform linear motion) ($a = 0$), uniform accelerated linear motion ($a = cte \ne 0$), and accelerated rectilinear motion ($a \ne cte$) [[3](#ref3)]. The cte term means constant [[4](#ref4)].
