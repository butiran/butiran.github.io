When charge, in any form, is present there will be an electric property associated with each point in space, where this property is known as electric field [[1](#ref1)], which is important important in many areas of physics [[2](#ref2)]. Electric field can also be viewed as the region around the electric charge in which the stress or electric force act [[3](#ref3)].


## definition
Electric field is defined as the electric force per unit charge [[4](#ref4)], where at a location it indicates the force that would act on a unit positive test charge if placed at that location [[5](#ref5)].
