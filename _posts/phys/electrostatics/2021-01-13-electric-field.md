When charge, in any form, is present there will be an electric property associated with each point in space, where this property is known as electric field [[1](#ref1)], which is important in many areas of physics [[2](#ref2)]. Electric field can also be viewed as the region around the electric charge in which the stress or electric force act [[3](#ref3)].


## definition
Electric field is defined as the electric force per unit charge [[4](#ref4)], where at a location it indicates the force that would act on a unit positive test charge if placed at that location [[5](#ref5)]. It can be formulated as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-electric-field}
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}, 
\end{equation}

with $q_0$ is the unit positive test charge. When we review again [Coulomb force](/electrostatics/coulomb-force) on charge $q_i$ due to existence of charge $q_j$

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-coulomb's-law}
\vec{F} _{ij} = k \frac{q_i q_j}{r _{ij}^2} \ \hat{r} _{ij},
\end{equation}

and set the the unit positive test charge as $q_i$ then we have

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-coulomb's-law-electric-field}
\vec{E}_j = \frac{\vec{F} _{ij}}{q_i} = k \frac{q_j}{r _{ij}^2} \ \hat{r} _{ij} \equiv \vec{E}_j(\vec{r}_i),
\end{equation}

where the last term means "due to charge $q_j$ located at $\vec{r}_j$ there will be electric field observed at position $\vec{r}_i$".


## electric field due to point charge

By changing $\vec{r}_i$ to more general position $\vec{r}$ and using the [relative position](/physics/position#relative-position) we can write

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-electric-field-point-charge}
\vec{E}_j(\vec{r}) = k \frac{q_j}{\| \vec{r} - \vec{r}_j \|^3} \ (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_j),
\end{equation}

which is electric field at arbitraty position $\vec{r}$ due to existence of charge $q_j$ located at $\vec{r}_j$.
