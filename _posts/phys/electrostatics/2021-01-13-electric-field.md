When charge, in any form, is present there will be an electric property associated with each point in space, where this property is known as electric field [[1](#ref1)], which is important in many areas of physics [[2](#ref2)]. Electric field can also be viewed as the region around the electric charge in which the stress or electric force act [[3](#ref3)].


## definition
Electric field is defined as the electric force per unit charge [[4](#ref4)], where at a location it indicates the force that would act on a unit positive test charge if placed at that location [[5](#ref5)]. It can be formulated as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-electric-field}
\vec{E} = \frac{\vec{F}}{q_0}, 
\end{equation}

with $q_0$ is the unit positive test charge. When we review again [Coulomb force](/electrostatics/coulomb-force) on charge $q_i$ due to existence of charge $q_j$

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-coulomb's-law}
\vec{F} _{ij} = k \frac{q_i q_j}{r _{ij}^2} \ \hat{r} _{ij},
\end{equation}

and set the the unit positive test charge as $q_i$ then we have

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-coulomb's-law-electric-field}
\vec{E}_j = \frac{\vec{F} _{ij}}{q_i} = k \frac{q_j}{r _{ij}^2} \ \hat{r} _{ij} \equiv \vec{E}_j(\vec{r}_i),
\end{equation}

where the last term means "due to charge $q_j$ located at $\vec{r}_j$ there will be electric field observed at position $\vec{r}_i$".

{: refdef}

Illustration to obtain electric field from a point charge $q_j$, where it can negative or positive, is given in Fig. <a ref="#fig:ef-electric-field-from-force-point-charge">1</a>. Implicitly source charge $q_j$ and unit positive test charge $q_i$ are located at $\vec{r}_j$ and $\vec{r}_i$, respectively.


## electric field due to point charge
By changing $\vec{r}_i$ to more general position $\vec{r}$ and using the [relative position](/physics/position#relative-position) we can write

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-electric-field-point-charge}
\vec{E}_j(\vec{r}) = k \frac{q_j}{\| \vec{r} - \vec{r}_j \|^3} \ (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_j),
\end{equation}

which is electric field at arbitraty position $\vec{r}$ due to existence of charge $q_j$ located at $\vec{r}_j$. Illustration of Eqn. \eqref{eqn:ef-electric-field-point-charge} is given in Fig. <a ref="#fig:ef-electric-field-point-charge">2</a>.

<br />
Figure <a name="fig:ef-electric-field-point-charge">2</a> Electric field $\vec{E}_j$ due to a point charge $q_j$.
{: refdef}

We can see from Fig. <a ref="#fig:ef-electric-field-point-charge">2</a> that what matter related to position is only relative position of observation point $\vec{r}$ to the position of source charge $q_j$ located at $\vec{r}_j$ or simply $\vec{r} - \vec{r}_j$.


## electric field due to charge distribution
In real world it is difficult to have a point charge, but group of charges that can assemble a charge distribution $dq_j$, which illustation is given in Fig. <a ref="#fig:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution">3</a>.

<br />
Figure <a name="fig:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution">3</a> Element of electric field $d\vec{E}_j$ due to element of charge distribution $q_j$.
{: refdef}

Instead of electric field $\vec{E}_j$ as in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:ef-electric-field-point-charge}, Fig. <a ref="#fig:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution">3</a> gives the element of electric field $d\vec{E}_j$ due to element of charge distribution $q_j$, which is formulated as

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution}
d\vec{E}_j(\vec{r}) = k \frac{dq_j}{\| \vec{r} - \vec{r}_j \|^3} \ (\vec{r} - \vec{r}_j),
\end{equation}

and to get the electric field field from Eqn. \eqref{eqn:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution}

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution-int}
\vec{E}_j(\vec{r}) = \int d\vec{E}_j(\vec{r}),
\end{equation}

simply do the integration.

Element of charge distribution $dq_j$ in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:ef-electric-field-charge-distribution} can be in the form of
