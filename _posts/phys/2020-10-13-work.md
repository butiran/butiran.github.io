Concept of work [[1](#ref1)] will be discussed here in brief.

## Work
In general work done by an object applyingg force $\vec{F}$ that can be varied with small displacement $d\vec{s}$ is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wket-work-integral}
W = \int \vec{F} \cdot d\vec{s},
\end{equation}

which is presented in form of force-displacement path integral using calculus [[2](#ref2)]. Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-work-integral} seems complicated and not practical since it is a general form, where $\vec{F} = \vec{F}(\vec{s})$. We will discuss some special cases of it.

### Force with constant magnitude
If we deal with a force with constant magnitude or $\vec{F} \ne \vec{F}(\vec{s})$ then Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-work-integral} will be simplified into

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:wket-work-integral-force-constant-magnitude
}
W = \vec{F} \cdot\int d\vec{s} = \vec{F} \cdot \vec{s}.
\end{equation}

The vector $\vec{F}$ can be moved outside of integral since it is not function of $\vec{s}$. We still have dot operation in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:wket-work-integral-force-constant-magnitude
} since the force can still have variation in its direction even its magnitude is constant or $\|\vec{F}\| = F_0$, where $F_0$ is a constant value.
