Friction can be caused when an object is moving while thouching another object due to surface roughness or when an object is travelling through fluid due to viscous resistance or air resistance [[1](#ref1)]. It is actually a force but not a fundamental one, that is resisting the relative motion between an object and the other object or medium or, e.g. solid surface or fluid layers [[2](#ref2)]


## Normal force
When two solid object are in contact, there will be normal force from one object to the other. Suppose that an object of mass $m$ is on top of a horizontal rough surface with coefficient friction $\mu$.
