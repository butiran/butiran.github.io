At the instant that ball 1 is at the top of its trajectory, ball 2 is dropped from rest from the same height. Which ball reaches the ground first? (a) Ball 1 reaches the ground first, since it is moving at the top of the trajectory, while ball 2 is dropped from rest.

5. The drawing shows two cars traveling in different directions with different speeds. Their velocities are: $\vec{v} _{AG}$ = velocity of car A relative to the Ground = 27.0 m/s, due east and $\vec{v} _{BG}$ = velocity of car B relative to the Ground = 21.0 m/s, due north.
The passenger of car B looks out the window and sees car A. What is the velocity (magnitude and direction) of car A as observed by the passenger of car B? In other words, what is the velocity $\vec{v} _{AB}$ of car A relative to car B? Give the directional angle of $\vec{v} _{AB}$ with respect to due east. <br/>Drawing is showin two cars.

A physical quantity, designates how fast and in what direction a point is moving, is velocity [[1](#ref1)].


## Notation
Velocity in vector form is presented using $\vec{v}$, sometimes is also $\vec{u}$. In general velocity

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-t}
\vec{v} = \vec{v}(t)
\end{equation}

is function of time $t$ and also its components

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-t-components}
\vec{v}(t) = v_x(t) \hat{i} + v_y(t) \hat{j} + v_z(t) \hat{k}.
\end{equation}

The functions $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$ can also be a constant value or simply zero.


## Relation to position
When we have position $\vec{r}$, velocity $\vec{v}$ can be obtained from it

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-from-r}
\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}
\end{equation}

using differential. Suppose we have

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-r-example-1}
\vec{r} = (t + 10) \hat{i} + (t^2 - 2t + 1) \hat{j} + 4 \hat{k},
\end{equation}

then the velocity is simply

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-v-example-1}
\vec{v} = \hat{i} + (2t - 2) \hat{j}
\end{equation}

using Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-from-r}.


## Relation to acceleration
If we have acceleration $\vec{a}$, velocity $\vec{v}$ can also be obtained from it

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-from-a}
\vec{v} = \int \vec{a} \ dt
\end{equation}

using integral. An initial condition in the form of $\vec{v}(t_0)$ is also required. Suppose we have

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-a-example-2}
\vec{a} = 3t^2 \ \hat{i} + (2t + 1) \hat{j} + \hat{k},
\end{equation}

and initial condition

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-a-example-2-ic}
\vec{v}(0) = \hat{i} + 2 \hat{j} + 3 \hat{k},
\end{equation}

where we choose that $t_0 = 0$. By introducing the lower and upper bounds to the integral in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-from-a}, we can have

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-v-example-2}
\vec{v}(t) - \vec{v}(0) = \int_0^{t} \vec{a} \ dt.
\end{equation}

Substitution of Eqns. \eqref{eqn:velo-a-example-2} and \eqref{eqn:velo-a-example-2-ic} to Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-v-example-2} will produce

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-v-example-2-2}
\vec{v}(t) - \left( \hat{i} + 2 \hat{j} + 3 \hat{k} \right) = \int_0^{t} \left[ 3t^2 \ \hat{i} + (2t + 1) \hat{j} + \hat{k} \right] \ dt.
\end{equation}

Solution of Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-v-example-2-2} is

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:velo-v-example-2-3}
\begin{array}{rl}
\vec{v}(t) & = & \left[ t^3 \ \hat{i} + (t^2 + t) \hat{j} + t \ \hat{k} \right]_{t = 0}^t +
\left( \hat{i} + 2 \hat{j} + 3 \hat{k} \right) \newline
& = & (t^3 + 1) \hat{i} + (t^2 + t + 2) \hat{j} + (t + 3) \hat{k}.
\end{array}
\end{equation}

You can put $t = 0$ into Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-v-example-2-3} to obtain Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-a-example-2-ic} and differentiate it to obtain Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-a-example-2}.


## Quantity with the same dimension
Velocity in Eqn. \eqref{eqn:velo-t} is known also as instantaneous velocity or velocity at specific time of the particle in a point along particle trajectory [[2](#ref2)]. This type of velocity is presented in a function of time $t$, that can be a continuous function or a discrete function such [step function velocity](step-function-velocity). Related to (instantaneous) velocity there are average velocity, speed, and [relative velocity](relative-velocity), which have the same dimension as velocity.


## Exercises
1. Find the velocity of a particle that has position of $\vec{r} = (t^4 - \cos 2t) \hat{i} + (1 - t^2) \hat{j} + 2 \hat{k}$. Remember hat $(d/dt)(\cos at) = - a\sin at$.
2. A particle has $a = (4t^3 - 2t) \ \rm m/s^2$. Find its velocity if $v(0) = 2 \ \rm m/s$.
3. Find velocity of a particle with acceleration $a = (-3t^2 + 5) \ \rm m/s^2$, where the initial velocity is $v(2) = 5 \ \rm m/s$.
4. A particle has a position of $\vec{r} = (2 \cos 0.25\pi t) \hat{i} + (2 \sin 0.25\pi t) \hat{j}$. Draw its position for $t = 0, 1, \dots, 7, 8$ and at each position draw its velocity vector. What form is the of particle trajectory?
5. A particle move with $x = 0.5 t^2$ and $a_y = 4$. If $v_{0y}(1) = 3$, find $\vec{v}$.
