The use of work-energy theorem in non-linear trajectory.


## Problem
A small $0.200-\rm kg$ package is released from rest at point A on a track that is one-quarter of a circle with radius $1.60 \ \rm m$. The size of the package is much less than $1.60 \ \rm m$, so the package can be treated as a particle. It slides down the track and reaches point B with a speed of $4.80 \ \rm m/s$. From point B, it slides on a level surface at distance of $3.00 \ \rm m$ to point C, where it comes to rest. (a) What is the coefficient of kinetic friction on the horizontal surface? (b) How much work is done on the package by friction as it slides down the circular arc from A to B? [&#8718;] See [[1](#ref1)] for illustration of package trajectory.


## Concepts
Following concepts are required to solve the problem:
1. kinematics equation
\begin{equation}
v_2^2 = v_1^2 + 2 a (x_2 - x_1)
\end{equation}
2. free-body diagram and 1st Newton's law in $y$ direction
\begin{equation}
\sum F_y = 0
\end{equation}
3. Gravitational force or weight
\begin{equation}
w = mg
\end{equation}
4. kinetic friction - normal force relation
\begin{equation}
f_k = \mu_k N
\end{equation}


## Solution
We do not need to solve the problem sequentially from segment A-B (one-quarter of circle) and then segment B-C (level surface). But we can start from the second question as suggested in the problem and then go to the first.

### Level surface
Information obtained from the problem are $v_B = 4.80 \ \rm m/s$, $v_C = 0 \ \rm m/s$, and $x_{BC} = 3.00 \ \rm m$.

## Note
The symbol [&#8718;] means that there is a diagram, figure, or graph, which is still illustrated using only text. Or a link to an image.
