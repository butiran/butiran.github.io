This entry is related to the questions part of [tutorial 4 in 2020-1](2020-1-04).


## Questions
1. Two objects have the same momentum. Do the velocities of these objects necessarily have (a) the same directions and (b) the same magnitudes? Give your reasoning in each case.
2. (a) Can a single object have kinetic energy but no momentum? (b) Can a system of two or more objects have a total kinetic energy that is not zero but a total momentum that is zero? Account for your answers.
3. Where would you expect the center of mass of a doughnut to be located? Why?
4. A satellite explodes in outer space, far from any other body, sending thousands of pieces in all directions. How does the linear momentum of the satellite before the explosion compare with the total linear momentum of all the pieces after the explosion? Account for your answer.
5. A boxer being hit with a punch tries to extend the time of contact for best results, whereas a karate expert delivers a blow in a short time for best results. Isn't there a contradiction here?
