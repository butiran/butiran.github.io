In uniform liniear motion (ULM) an object will move with constant velocty along a straight line [[1](#ref1)]. This constant velocty motion is also known as uniform rectilinear motion (URM) [[2](#ref1)]. This motion is part of linear motion, which is also called uniform motion or rectilinear motion, motion in one spatial dimension [[3](#ref3)]. There some physics concepts related to motion [[4](#ref4)].
