Examples of momentum and impulse are discussed here.

## P01
Two point mass particles perform a one-dimensional collision. Mass of the first particle is $2 \ \rm kg$ and of the second is $1 \ \rm kg$. Before the collision their velocities are $2 \ \rm m/s$ and $-4 \ \rm m/s$. After the collision velocity of the second particle is $2 \ \rm m/s$.
+ Find final velocity of the first particle.
+ Calculate total kinetic energy of the system before collision.
+ Calculate total kinetic energy of the system after collision.
+ Calculate the change of kinetic energy during the collision and determine whether it is an elastic collision or not.


## P02
In a one-dimensional collision of two point mass particle initial velocities of first and second particles are $2 \ \rm m/s$ and $-4 \ \rm m/s$, respectively. Final velocity of the first particle is $-2 \ \rm m/s$. Mass of the particles are $2 \ \rm kg$ and $1 \ \rm kg$.
+ Find final velocity of the second particle.
+ Calculate velocity of center of mass of the system before and after + Find change of kinetic due to collision.
collision.
+ Determine whether it is an elastic collision or not.


## P03
First particle moves with initial velocity $4 \ \rm m/s$ collides a stationary second particle. After the collision the first particle stops and the second moves with a certain velociyt. Both particles have identical mass.
+ Calculate velocity of center of mass of the system before collision.
+ What suppose the velocity of center of mass after collision? Why>
+ Find final velocity of the the second particle.
+ Calculate the coefficient of restitution (COR) between two paricles
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmi-cor}
e = - \left( \frac{v_{1f} - v_{2f}}{v_{1i} - v_{2i}} \right).
\end{equation}


## P04
In one-dimensional elastic collision or $e = 1$ following formulations

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmi-elastic-collision-1d-v1f}
v_{1f} = \left( \frac{m_1 - m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_{1i} + \left( \frac{2 m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_{2i}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmi-elastic-collision-1d-v2f}
v_{2f} = \left( \frac{2 m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_{1i} + \left( \frac{m_2 - m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right) v_{2i}
\end{equation}

hold. Two particle with mass of $1 \ \rm kg$ and $1 \ \rm kg$ have initial velocities of $2 \ \rm m/s$ and $-4 \ \rm m/s$, respectively.
