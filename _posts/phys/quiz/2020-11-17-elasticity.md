## P01
Two point mass particles perform a one-dimensional collision. Mass of the first particle is $2 \ \rm kg$ and of the second is $1 \ \rm kg$. Before the collision their velocities are $2 \ \rm m/s$ and $-4 \ \rm m/s$. After the collision velocity of the second particle is $2 \ \rm m/s$.

\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmi-elastic-collision-1d-v2f}

There are two particles perform a two-dimensional collision on top of a level and frictionless surface.

Mass of the first particle is $2 \ \rm kg$, while the second is $\sqrt{3} \ \rm kg$.

## P10
In a one-dimensional collision of two particles, where the collision has a certain coefficient of restitution (COR), the formulation will be different than in Eqns. \eqref{eq:qmi-elastic-collision-1d-v1f} and \eqref{eq:qmi-elastic-collision-1d-v2f}, which will be as follow

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmi-cor-collision-1d-v1f}
v_{1f} = \left[ \frac{m_1 - e m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right] v_{1i} + \left[ \frac{(1 + e) m_2}{m_1 + m_2} \right] v_{2i}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:qmi-cor-collision-1d-v2f}
v_{2f} = \left[ \frac{(1 + e) m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right] v_{1i} + \left[ \frac{m_2 - e m_1}{m_1 + m_2} \right] v_{2i},
