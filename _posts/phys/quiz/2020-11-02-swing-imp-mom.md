Two successive collisions, the first is swinging pendulum with a block and the second is moving block with another block, are discussed here.


## Problem
A system of swinging pendulum ($m_0 + m_1$) and two blocks ($m_2$ and $m_3$) on top of a frictionless ($\mu_k = 0$), horizontal surface is shown in Fig. <a href="#fig:sim-system">1</a>.

<br />
Figure <a name="fig:sim-system">1</a> A pendulum swings and hits first block, transfer all its kinetic energy and momentum to it, later the first block collides second block and transfers only partially its kinetic energy and momentum.

It would be better and easier if we divide the problem into four consecutive parts, where in each part some related concepts are applied.


## Concept
Following concepts are required in solving the problem
1. Moment of inertia
2. Conservation of energy
3. Conservation of momentum


## Note
There are some assumption used in solving this problem.
