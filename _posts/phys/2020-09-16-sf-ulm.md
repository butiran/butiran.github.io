A particle can moving with different constant velocity in different time interval. This type of motion, it should have a [step function velocty](step-function-velocity). In each time interval it has a [uniform linear motion](uniform-linear-motion).


## Illustration of 1-d motion
Suppose that there are five points A, B, C, D, and E located along a straight line. A particle will move from one point to another one. This motion can be considered as a one-dimensional (1-d) motion. We choose $x$ direction in describing this problem. Coodinate of all points are

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:sfulm-points-ABCED}
x_A = 1 \ {\rm m}, \ x_B = 3 \ {\rm m}
\end{equation}
